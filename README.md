Development container for websites by @parsingphase (Richard George, richard@phase.org)

Note that this project is not designed for general use; there **will** be BC breaks on a regular basis as library code gets bounced off into its own project. Those subprojects will probably be more stable that this core.

## SETUP

 - Copy config/config.php.dist to config.php and edit
 - Copy web/index.php.dist to index.php and edit
